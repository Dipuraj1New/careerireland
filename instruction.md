# Career Ireland Immigration SaaS: Development Guidelines

## üåü Core Development Principles

### Extreme Programming (XP) Methodology
- **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate code frequently (at least daily)
- **Pair Programming**: Collaborate on complex features for knowledge sharing
- **Simple Design**: Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements
- **Refactoring**: Continuously improve code quality without changing behavior
- **Small Releases**: Deliver value in small, frequent increments
- **Collective Ownership**: Everyone can improve any part of the codebase
- **Sustainable Pace**: Maintain consistent productivity without burnout
- **Whole Team**: Include all stakeholders in the development process
- **Continuous Feedback**: Gather and incorporate feedback throughout development

### Modular Architecture
- **Microservices Approach**: Develop loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **Clean Interfaces**: Define clear API contracts between modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module should have one reason to change
- **Dependency Injection**: Use DI for service composition and testability
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Use events for cross-module communication

  - Follow consistent formatting (use ESLint and Prettier)
  - Keep functions small and focused (under 25 lines when possible)
  - Use TypeScript for type safety and better IDE support
  - Comment complex logic, but let self-documenting code speak for itself

- **Practice Test-Driven Development**
  - Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
  - Aim for 80%+ test coverage for critical paths
  - Test both happy paths and edge cases
  - Mock external dependencies appropriately
  - Write tests at multiple levels (unit, integration, E2E)

- **Implement Proper Error Handling**
  - Use custom error classes for domain-specific errors
  - Provide meaningful error messages with context
  - Log errors with appropriate severity levels
  - Implement graceful degradation for critical services
  - Fail fast and explicitly when invalid states are detected

- **Optimize Performance**
  - Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
  - Implement caching for expensive operations
  - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
  - Use asynchronous operations for I/O-bound tasks
  - Profile before optimizing to identify actual bottlenecks

- **Apply SOLID Principles**
  - Single Responsibility: Each class/module has one reason to change
  - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
  - Interface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on unused methods
  - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not implementations

### DON'T:
- **Avoid Code Duplication**
  - Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or services
  - Use shared libraries for common functionality
  - Implement proper abstractions for similar operations
  - Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle consistently
